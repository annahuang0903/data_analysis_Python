#%%  This is the start of a cell.  It's
##   frequently handy to split your code 
##   into cells.  It also makes the 
##   keyboard shortcuts work correctly.

#%%  Each #%% ends the preceding cell and
##   starts the next.

####   Arithmetic with Python

2+5  # The sum of 2 and 5

#%%  

-3*7  # The product of -3 and 7

#%% 

15/7  # 15 divided by 7; 

#%%

2**5  # 2 to the power 5; ^ is not exponentiation!!

#%%  Python only displays the last calculated value
##   in iPython.

2**5
7-4

#%%  Use "print" to display multple values (and other
##   stuff too, as we'll see later.)

print(2**5)
print(7-4)

#%%
